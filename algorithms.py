    # Given a numeric value, determine if it is even or odd.
    # The function should take the value in as a parameter and return a boolean value (True if even, False if odd).
    # Leave a comment above the function stating the time complexity.
    # Send a screenshot of your solution and time complexity comment to your personal instructors chat.

#boolean example: 

# non-boolean example:
number = int(input('Please enter a number: '))
if (number % 2 == 0):
    print(number, ' is an even number')
else:
    print(number, ' is an odd number')


# Task 2: Less than 100
    # Given a list of numbers, determine if each item in the list is lower than 100.
    # The function should take in the list as a parameter and return a boolean value (False if there are any numbers greater than or equal to 100, True if all numbers are less than 100).
    # Leave a comment above the function stating the time complexity.
    # Send a screenshot of your solution and time complexity comment to your personal instructors chat.

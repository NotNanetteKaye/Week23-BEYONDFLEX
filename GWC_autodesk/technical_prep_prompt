# Imagine you are a librarian and want to develop an inventory management system that keeps track of which books are in the library and which ones have been checked out. Write a program with the following functionality:

# The user can print out a list of each book and its status (“on shelf” or “checked out”) 
# The user can add new books to the inventory. The default status of newly added books will be “on shelf”
# The user can toggle the status of each book between “on shelf” and “checked out”
# The user should interact with the program using the command line interface. Your solution can be in the language of your choosing. If you have time, think about what other functionality you might add. Try to implement it for an extra challenge!
